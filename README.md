# ðŸ’Š Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Prediction Web App

This project is a web-based application for predicting **drug-drug interactions (DDIs)** using machine learning models. It integrates biomedical datasets (like TWOSIDES, DrugBank, and RDF2Vec embeddings) with pre-trained models (MLP, XGBoost) to identify potential adverse interactions between drugs.

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

- âœ… Built with **Flask** (Python)
- ðŸ§¬ Uses drug embeddings (`rdf2vec`) and curated drug name mappings
- ðŸ¤– Pre-trained models:
  - `MLP` (`.h5` file)
  - `XGBoost` (`.pkl` and `.json`)
- ðŸ“Š Data: TWOSIDES, DrugBank, RxNorm mappings
- ðŸ§ª Web interface for predicting and displaying interactions

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Logicrithm/DDI.git
cd DDI
```
2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install required packages:

```bash
